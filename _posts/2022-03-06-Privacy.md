Bot Privacy Policy [¶](#bot "Permanent link")
=============================

This page covers the Privacy Policy of the Discord Bot *Nezuko*

-------------------------------------------------------

### Usage of Data[¶](#usage-of-data "Permanent link")

The bot may use stored data, as defined below, for different features including but not limited to: Welcoming joining users (when enabled) and command handling.  
No usage of data outside of the aformentioned cases will happen and the data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.

### Stored Information[¶](#stored-information "Permanent link")

The bot may store the following information automatically when being invited to a new Discord Server:
*   `id` with the Server's ID as value.
*   `user id` with the User's ID as value.
*   `language` with value `en`
*   `username` with value User's Username as value.

Other stored data may include the user's level, coins and profile customization made on Nezuko.

No other information outside of the above mentioned one will be stored.

### Updating Data[¶](#updating-data "Permanent link")

The data may be updated when using specific commands.  
Updating data will require the input of an end user, and data that can be seen as sensitive, such as content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands.

No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

### Temporarely stored Information[¶](#temporarely-stored-information "Permanent link")

The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time.  
After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

Data may be dropped from cache pre-maturely through actions such as removing the bot from the Server.

### Removal of Data[¶](#removal-of-data "Permanent link")

#### Automatic removal[¶](#automatic-removal "Permanent link")

Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as mentioned above, back to the bot's database.

#### Manual removal[¶](#manual-removal "Permanent link")

Manual removal of the data can be requested through email at [support@miaxu.co](mailto:support@miaxu.co).  
For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.

Technical limitations

The automatic removal of data has certain limitations that we cannot fix or avoid.  
Limitations include, but aren't limited to, downtime of the bot due to maintenance or technical issues at our hosting provider or Discord Inc.

In such events can you request [manual removal](#manual-removal) through email under the above mentioned conditions.
